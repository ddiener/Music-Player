Hello!

My name is Dylan Diener and this is my submission for Project 5
for CSCI 1302. 

Upon opening this folder, there is:

     -the classes directory: this contains all of classes of the compiled java
     programs in the edu/uga/cs1302/mytunes folder.
     -the html directory: this contains all of the compiled javadoc notations
     from the programs in the edu/uga/cs1302/mytunes folder.
     -this .txt file
     - the edu directory - contains multiple directories that eventually contiain several 
     files:
	-MP3Player.java - this program plays the .mp3 files that are encountered
	in the other programs
	-MP3File.java - this makes .mp3 files into objects containing their ID3
	tags as well as their pathname.
	-SimpleArrayList.java - this is used to create ArrayLists and their respective 
	iterators that are to be used in the collection.
	-MP3Collection.java - this file creates an object that stores and orgainzes 
	.mp3 files in a directory in a ArrayList and can do tasks with it.
	-MyTunesControls.java - this file creates the MyTunes object that is to be displayed
	later in the MyTunes program
	-MyTunes.java - creates a screen that displays the MyTunes object created by the MyTunesControl
	program
	-sample_music directory - a directory that contains several sample .mp3 files
